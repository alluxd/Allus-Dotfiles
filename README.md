For wallpapers: https://github.com/JaKooLit/Wallpaper-Bank, or search for ones in wallhaven.cc, they have awesome wallpapers!

## Tested on Fedora 40, it might work on other distros like Arch, Void, NixOS etc. Try it out for yourselves.

## Stuff you need
**pywal16
pywalfox
bluetoothctl, bluez, bluez-utils
alacritty
rofi-lbonn-wayland (for better compatibility)
hyprland, hyprlock
dunst
neovim
visual studio code (optional)
nwg-look, swww (you need to build it if both are not available in your package manager)
tokyonight-gtk-theme (my fav, optional)
vesktop**

For Fedora users: If you face any missing dependency error while installing nwg-look, swww or rofi-lbonn-wayland, run ``sudo dnf update``, if it still does not fix anything, post the erros to ChatGPT, that is how I got rid of them. Sorry for the unproper documentation on this!
