## Changes: [check here](changes.md)

Rice based on Catppuccin Mocha, the dark variant of the soothing pastel Catppuccin theme.




## Programs

### Main
``hyprland, hyprlock, waybar, rofi-lbonn-wayland (better on wayland), spicetify (spotify from flatpak + spicetify), bluez, bluez-utils, blueman-manager, wlogout, pulseaudio, alacritty, nautilus, wl-copy``

### Daemons and stuff (REQUIRED!)
**Notifications: Dunst, (or swaync, mako etc.)** (Will work nonetheless of what you choose)
**Wallpaper: swww**
**GTK: nwg-look** (there are possible alternatives) 
**Colors: pywal16 (if you use it)**

### Additional Stuff
**Code Editors: Neovim, VSCode, etc** (with a catppuccin theme)
**Music: Spotify (via flatpak) + [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app)** (get the catppuccin theme from the marketplace)
**Browser: Firefox** (With [this guide](https://github.com/catppuccin/firefox).)


> Most of these are available on package managers on mostly all distros. Some packages like pywal16 are on `pip`. `swww` and `nwg-look` are both available on some distros so you have to build it from source from the instructions in their repos, nwg-[look](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-look), [swww](https://github.com/LGFae/swww).

> Make sure to download the catppuccin mocha gtk theme from the gtk-themes folder in this repo and paste it in ~/.themes (create if it does not exist), and open "GTK Settings" from rofi and change the theme to it.
