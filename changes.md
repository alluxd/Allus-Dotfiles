- Changed dunst styling, might use swaync soon.
- Waybar looks better, i think?
- I'm currently using sddm instead of gdm, with the astronaut theme, i will try to upload that later!
- Changed app launcher icon
- Using roman numerals for now on waybar
- Using `blueman-manager` instead of a rofi menu, so you need to click the bluetooth icon to do stuff with Bluetooth, but I did not remove the script.
- Added power profiles to waybar
- Hyprlock changes
